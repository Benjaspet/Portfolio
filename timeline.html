                        During the year after the start of COVID-19, I had free time due to my school's hybrid
                        learning schedule. I wanted to expand my knowledge even further before applying to college
                        in the fall of that year.

                        At this point I had only known PHP and Python, PHP being from browsing PocketMine-MP plugin source
                        code and by watching videos, and Python being from a course in my school.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I took online courses in Java and began creating plugins for Bukkit and Spigot. I enrolled
                        in online fullstack development courses, eventually picking up CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

                        I did not do much development during the fall and winter of 2019-20. This was primarily because
                        of my rigorous high school courseload and extracurricular activities; I simply did not have enough
                        time.

                        As COVID began, I became very bored being cooped up in my house. From here, I decided to dive
                        even deeper into my programming interest. I began doing commissions for PocketMine-MP servers,
                        developing mods and plugins for pay.

                    <p>
                        I created my own Minecraft: Bedrock Edition player-versus-player server and developed its own
                        core. The server was known as Helios Practice and ran until February 2021.

                    <h2>Development Interest Sparks</h2>
                    <p>
                        In April 2019, during the spring of my freshman year at Boston College High School, my interest
                        in development began. During this time, I was an active Minecraft player and enjoyed playing
                        online with my friends. I was intrigued on how developers were able to mod the game and wanted
                        to do it for myself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From this point, I began developing PocketMine-MP plugins for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. These
                        plugins were written initially in PHP 7. I managed to create quite a few of these plugins
                        during the summer of 2019. I wrote the majority of these plugins for my own private server, and
                        slowly began doing commissions during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

                    <h2>Boston College High School Career Begins</h2>
                    <p>
                        On September 4, 2016, I began my career as a middle school student at Boston College High School
                        in Dorchester, Massachusetts as I applied and was accepted into the Arrupe Division.

                    <p>
                        In grades 7 and 8, I became very involved in the school & extracurricular activities, some of
                        which include the following:

                            <li> Cross Country <br>
                                I was a member of the cross-country team in the fall of both my 7th and 8th grade years.
                                I placed 3rd overall in the Catholic Conference Championship race in the 2017-2018 season.

                            <li> Track & Field <br>
                                I also ran track, competing in long-distance racing (400x400m, 800m, etc). I did long jump
                                as well during this time.
                            </li>
                            <li> Tennis <br>
                                I played on the Arrupe tennis team in both 7th and 8th grade, playing both singles and
                                doubles rounds.
                            </li>
                            <li> Table Tennis Club <br>
                                I became the co-leader of the table tennis club, facilitating both casual and competitive
                                play as well as monthly tournaments and intramural events.
