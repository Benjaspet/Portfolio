                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Hey there! I'm <b>Ben Petrillo</b>, also known by my online alias <b>Eerie</b>.</p>
                    <p>
                        I'm currently a senior in high school. I'll be pursuing a combined major of Computer Science
                        and Mathematics at Northeastern University starting in the fall of 2022. I have a strong
                        passion for technology, mathematics, and anything STEM-related.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I enjoy spending time with friends. During the school year, I have less time for
                        development due to academics and the extracurricular activities I am involved in.
                        I love playing competitive tennis and table tennis, watching anime, and giving back
                        to my communities via community service and other means. I also have approximately three
                        years of experience in fullstack development, with most of my skills in Java, PHP,
                        TypeScript, and Python.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This page outlines the general timeline of my projects, activities, education,
                        and achievements, starting at age 13. Below you can find some of my socials and
                        other resources.

                        I do a lot outside of development. I play tennis, competitive table tennis, run cross country,
                        and do track. I love fishing, tubing, boating, and spending time on the water.
