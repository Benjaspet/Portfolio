  <h2>An Hour</h2>
  <p>
    A short poem discussing time and its lasting effects. Composed October 12, 2017.

  <hr>
  <p>
    Five hours to sleep, one to shower;<br>
    School starts in just an hour.<br>
    Too much homework the night before,<br>
    too little time to settle the score.
  </p>
  <p>
    Who would have known: why are we here?<br>
    What is the purpose of living in fear?<br>
    Be not afraid, they always say --<br>
    it's how you make the most of your day.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we were destined to cream the crops<br>
    of a life ever so fruitful that never stops,<br>
    it makes me wonder how much time<br>
    we've spent it exploring the sublime.
  </p>
  <p>
    If there's anything I've learned<br>
    from the life I deserve,<br>
    it's to live it day by day, verse by verse,<br>
    blow by blow, curse by curse.
