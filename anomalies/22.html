  <h2>SCP-6022</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Object class:</strong> Keter
  </p>
  <h3>Containment Procedures</h3>
  <p>
    SCP-6022 is to be stored securely within the foundation, and is to be accessed strictly by personnel of Level 3 or
    higher, and no one else. Knowledge of SCP-6022 can be spread to other levels, but is to remain within the foundation
    itself and should not be spread to the outside world.

    The organism must be contained in an environment similar to that of its natural habitat in the Madagascar lowlands.
    A source of light, either natural or artificial, must be provided. The anomaly must be provided with a source of
    life or intelligence to bond with every week; if this is not provided, the organism may perish naturally. It is
    required for members of the foundation, when within a proximity of Anomaly-22 of 20 feet or fewer, to wear a gas
    mask or some other protective facial covering. Inhaling the spores produced by Anomaly-22 may result in the bonding
    process to occur.
  </p>
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    SCP-6022 refers to a hypothesized eukaryotic organism which has the capability to bond directly to the minds
    and bodies of living creatures. It is composed of several known organisms, including but not limited to the
    following species of fungi: Chytridiomycota, Zygomycota, and Ascomycota. The organism itself, however, can only
    bond to certain organisms that possess incredibly precise and accurate vision. The reason for which the organism
    only bonds to creatures possessing this characteristic is unknown.
  </p>
  <h4>Discovery</h4>
  <p>
    SCP-6022 was initially discovered on October 23, 2014, in the midst of the Madagascan lowland forests. To date,
    SCP-6022 has not been found to inhabit any other location outside this territory, and the foundation has secured
    the anomaly to prevent it from spreading. The anomaly needs a source of life to properly sustain itself -- it is
    unable to survive without some source of intelligence and/or life.
  </p>
  <h4>Addendum</h4>
  <p>
    Side effects of being exposed to or in the near presence of SCP-6022 include but are by no means limited to the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Nausea, with vomit of a black-ish color and of high viscosity.
    </li>
    <li>
      Nose bleeding, with blood of a dark red color.
    </li>
    <li>
      Severe psychological breakdowns, hallucinations, headaches, & ringing noises.
    </li>
    <li>
      Unnaturally dark bruises on the legs and torso.
    </li>
  </ul>
